With this program, you will be able to get information about the cluster(s) and table(s) that you have stored in Cassandra at the point of running. 


Before doing anything with the application, *RUN CASSANDRA* (either by using Command Prompt in Cassandra's location in File Explorer for Windows OS or through Terminal for Mac/Linux OS) or you will run into several errors trying to run methods from an application that isn't running.

If you are running this application on a device using Mac OS or Linux OS:
	After opening Cassandra, you will need to run the nodetool.sh Shell file through your Terminal by moving to the correct directory and typ. 

If you are running this application on a device using Windows OS:
	After opening Cassandra, you will need to run clusterInfo.bat and tableStats.bat Batch files through your Java compiler.
